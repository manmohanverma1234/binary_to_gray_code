# binary_to_gray_code
The reflected binary code or Gray code is an ordering of the binary numeral system such that two successive values differ in only one bit (binary digit).
For conversion of binary number into a Gray code number, following rules are applied.

The most significant digit (left-most digit) in the Gray code is the same as the corresponding digit in the binary number.
Going from left to right, add each adjacent pair of binary digits to get the next Gray code digit. Discard carries if any.
